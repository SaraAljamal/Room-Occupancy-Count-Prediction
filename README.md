# Room-Occupancy-Count-Prediction
This project aims to predict room occupancy counts using sensor data. It explores four different classification algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, both with and without grid search. The project also includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and thorough data preprocessing.
