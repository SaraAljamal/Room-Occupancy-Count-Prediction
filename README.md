# Room-Occupancy-Count-Prediction
This project aims to predict room occupancy counts using sensor data. It explores four different classification algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost, both with and without grid search. The project also includes comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and thorough data preprocessing.

_**Problem Statement**_

The goal of this project is to predict the number of occupants in a room based on sensor data. This information can be critical for optimizing energy consumption and improving resource management in buildings.

_**Dataset**_

The Projectâ€™s dataset contained 10130 records each record at different time and 18 features where each one represents a sensor reading such as CO2 and temperature.

_**Project Workflow**_
1.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset, the relationship between the features and the target, and more.

2.	Data Preprocessing: Which involves cleaning the data and preparing it for the modeling stage such as scaling the data and dropping unnecessary columns. 

3.	Modelling stage: Implementing 4 classification algorithms, RF, SVM, Gradient boosting, XG boost, where each one was implemented with or without grid search to evaluate performance. 

_**Tech Stack**_
- Python: The main programming language used
- Pandas: For data manipulation
- Numpy: For numerical operations
- Scikit-learn: For model building and evaluation, and data preprocessing
- Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
- Google Colab: The main tool used for coding and experimentation
